#
# setup wishlist with a SSH config file
#

# Host will be endpoint's name
Host foo
	# HostName will be used as the host part of the address
	HostName bar
	# Port will be used as the port part of the address
	Port 2223
	# User that should be used to connect to the remote host
	User notme

	# all other SSH options are ignored
	# wildcard Hosts are also ignored

# Having only the Host key also works, it'll be both the endpoint's name and
#  hostname, using 22 as default port
Host ssh.example.com
