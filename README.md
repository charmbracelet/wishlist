# wishlist

Wishlist is a directory for SSH Apps, and a SSH app itself.

It can be used to start multiple SSH apps within a single package, and provide a list of them over SSH as well.
You can also list apps provided elsewhere.

You can also use the `wishlist` CLI to just start a listing of external SSH apps based on a JSON config file.

## Auth

* if ssh agent forwarding is available, it will be used
* otherwise, each session will create a new ed25519 key and use it, in which case your app will be to allow access to any public key
* password auth is not supported
