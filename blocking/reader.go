// from another io.Reader, for example, a bytes.Buffer.
//
// We need that because when we connect into an app through wishlist, we need
// to keep a copy of STDIN (named handoffstdin in most places). That copy is a
// bytes.Buffer, which would EOF on last byte, but we are still writing to
// it... so it shouldn't really EOF. Hence, this Reader. It'll never EOF, and
// will keep trying to read until another error happens.
